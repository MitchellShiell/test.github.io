Access to sensitive and valuable information requires complex and secure methods to verify users and authorize what data and applications they are allowed to access. [Ego](https://www.overture.bio/products/ego/) is an open-source authentication and authorization microservice, providing secure user registration and permission management. Ego uses well-known single-sign-on identity providers like Google, GitHub, LinkedIn and ORCiD in place of managing usernames and passwords. If you'd like to run Ego with a user interface see our [Ego UI repo](https://github.com/overture-stack/ego-ui).

## Documentation

- See our Developer [wiki](https://github.com/overture-stack/ego/wiki)
- For user installation guide see our website [here](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/ego/installation/)
- For administrative guidance see our website [here](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/)

## Developer Setup

**1. Set up a google oauth client app. [See here](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/ego/installation/prereq/#google) for more details**

- *Note it may take **5 minutes to a few hours** for settings to take effect*

</br>

**2. Clone or Download the repository and update the  ```docker-compose-all.yml``` file with your client id and secret** 

```
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.clientId : "<insert-provided-client-Id>"
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.clientSecret: "<insert-provided-clientSecret>"
```

**3. Open Docker desktop and then run the following command from your CLI**

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-all.yml up 
```


**4. Ego requires seed data to authorize the Ego UI as a client using the following command**

*Alternatively if you have ```Make``` installed you can run  ```make init-db```*
```
docker exec ego-postgres-1  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d ego --command "INSERT INTO EGOAPPLICATION (name, clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri, description, status, errorredirecturi) VALUES ('ego ui', 'ego-ui', 'secret', 'http://localhost:8080/', '...', 'APPROVED', 'http://localhost:8080/error') on conflict do nothing"
```

**5. You can now access the Ego UI through ```http://localhost:8080/ego-ui```**
- This will require your google sign in 
- Once signed in you will have access to the admin dashboard
- The Ego swagger ui can be located at ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html```
